### For content

- We are only interested in Australian based events, and no earlier than 2016
- The event should be of interest to the dev community (specialist and related topics are fine e.g. AI and agile)
- Please add events in chronological order within the relevant year
- Check any links you are adding are correct
- Ensure dates are in dd-mmm-yyyy format (in case we want to parse this data later). For example, `01-Jan-2019`. Use TBC if the date is unconfirmed or unknown.
- Ensure no additional spaces or formatting characters are present (this will make parsing easier later)
- Ensure states are specified as VIC, NSW, ACT, WA, SA, NT, QLD, ALL, TAS, OTH (Other)

### For Meetups

- Currently only active meetup pages are listed on the main page
- If you are adding meetups to a new state page, ensure you add the page link to the main events page
